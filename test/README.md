# Tests Folder

The `tests` folder contains all the testing-related files and scripts to ensure the quality and reliability of the project. These tests are structured to verify that the application's components behave as expected under various conditions.

## Purpose
- Validate the correctness of the code.
- Catch bugs and regressions early.
- Ensure that new features do not break existing functionality.

## Contents

### 1. Unit Tests
Unit tests validate individual components or functions in isolation:
- Located in `unit/`.
- File naming convention: `test_<component>.py` or `<component>_test.js`.

### 2. Integration Tests
Integration tests ensure that different modules or services work together as expected:
- Located in `integration/`.
- File naming convention: `test_<integration_scenario>.py` or `<scenario>_test.js`.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
E2E tests simulate user workflows to validate the application from start to finish:
- Located in `e2e/`.
- Tools used: Selenium, Cypress, or similar frameworks.

### 4. Mock Data and Fixtures
Mock data and reusable testing configurations:
- Located in `fixtures/`.
- Used for setting up consistent test environments.

### 5. Test Reports
Generated test reports for tracking and analysis:
- Located in `reports/`.
- Format: HTML, JSON, or text files.

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- Ensure all dependencies are installed:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python projects
  npm install                      # For JavaScript/Node.js projects
  ```

### Commands
- **Run Unit Tests:**
  ```bash
  pytest tests/unit/               # For Python
  npm run test:unit                # For JavaScript
  ```

- **Run Integration Tests:**
  ```bash
  pytest tests/integration/        # For Python
  npm run test:integration         # For JavaScript
  ```

- **Run E2E Tests:**
  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e                 # For JavaScript
  ```

- **Generate Reports:**
  ```bash
  pytest --html=reports/report.html
  ```

## Best Practices
- Write descriptive test cases for clarity.
- Use fixtures and mock data to simulate environments.
- Group related tests into folders for organization.
- Always run tests before merging code to the main branch.

## Adding New Tests
1. Create a new test file in the appropriate folder (`unit`, `integration`, `e2e`).
2. Write test cases using the relevant testing framework (e.g., Pytest, Jest, Mocha).
3. Run the test locally to ensure it works as expected.
4. Submit a pull request with the new tests.

## Troubleshooting
- **Tests fail unexpectedly:**
  - Ensure the environment matches the expected configuration.
  - Verify that mock data and dependencies are up to date.

- **Slow test execution:**
  - Optimize database or service mock configurations.
  - Use parallel test execution if supported by the framework.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to the tests:
1. Follow the structure and naming conventions outlined above.
2. Write concise and focused tests.
3. Update this README if new test categories or tools are added.

# Scripts Folder

The `scripts` folder contains utility and automation scripts that aid in the development, deployment, and management of the project. These scripts are designed to streamline workflows and ensure consistency across environments.

## Contents

### 1. Deployment Scripts
Scripts for deploying the application to various environments (e.g., development, staging, production):
- **`deploy.sh`**: Automates deployment using Docker or cloud services.
- **`rollback.sh`**: Reverts to a previous deployment version in case of failure.

### 2. Setup and Initialization
Scripts for setting up the project on new systems:
- **`setup.sh`**: Installs dependencies and initializes the project.
- **`init_db.sh`**: Sets up the database schema and seeds initial data.

### 3. Testing and Quality Assurance
Scripts for running tests and ensuring code quality:
- **`run_tests.sh`**: Executes unit and integration tests.
- **`lint.sh`**: Checks for linting errors and enforces coding standards.

### 4. Maintenance Scripts
Scripts for managing the project:
- **`clean_temp_files.sh`**: Removes temporary and cache files.
- **`backup.sh`**: Creates a backup of the database and other critical files.

### 5. Monitoring and Debugging
Scripts to help monitor and debug the application:
- **`monitor_logs.sh`**: Streams application logs for real-time monitoring.
- **`debug.sh`**: Runs the application in debug mode with verbose logging.

## Usage
To execute any script, navigate to the project root directory and run the desired script using the terminal. For example:
```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

### Notes:
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute scripts:
  ```bash
  chmod +x scripts/<script_name>.sh
  ```
- Some scripts may require environment variables to be set. Refer to the `.env.example` file for guidance.

## Best Practices
- Always review a script before running it to ensure it aligns with your needs.
- Avoid making changes to scripts directly in this folder. Instead, propose changes through a pull request to maintain version control.
- Document any new scripts in this README to keep the folder organized.
